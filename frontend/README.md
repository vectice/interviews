# Getting Started with the Vectice Front-End Interview

## Clone this project

Clone the repository locally

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vectice/interviews.git
```

## Install the necessary dependencies

Everything is already set-up in the package.json.
Install the dependencies using you prefered package manager

```bash
yarn
```

```bash
npm install
```

## It's TDD time

The interview consist of running the existing test, then writing the necessary code in `App.tsx`.

You can run the tests using the following command:

```bash
yarn test
```

```bash
npm run test
```

The query should be written in `getProjectList.ts`.
To help you write it, you can find the graphQL schema in `schema.gql`.

## Going even further beyond

Once the current tests are green, feel free to improve the code:
- refactor your code
- add more features
- improve the current test
- add more tests
- anything else that would make the code production ready
